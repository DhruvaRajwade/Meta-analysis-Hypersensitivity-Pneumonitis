# Results:

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that increased age, male sex, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis patterns on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images are the major mortality-related risk factors of patients with HP. In case of chronic HP, antigen exposure appeared to be an additional risk factor.
